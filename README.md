# Polygon Area Calculator

This is my solution to the Polygon Area Calculator project from the Scientific Computing with Python course on FreeCodeCamp.

## Description

Polygon Area Calculator is a Python program designed to simplify the process of calculating the area of various polygons. It offers a user-friendly interface for calculating the area of common polygons, including rectangles, squares, triangles, and pentagons. Users can input the dimensions or side lengths of the polygon, and the program will provide an accurate area calculation.

**Key Features:**

- **Support for Multiple Polygons:** The calculator accommodates a variety of polygon types, making it versatile for different geometric shapes.
- **Dimension Input:** Easily specify the dimensions or side lengths of the polygon to obtain precise area calculations.
- **Practical Use:** Whether you're a student studying geometry or need a practical tool for everyday applications, the Polygon Area Calculator simplifies area calculations for a wide range of polygons.
